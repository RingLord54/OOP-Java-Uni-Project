# OOP-Java-Uni-Project
## About
This Object Oriented Programming Project uses Java to create a basic functioning Retail Warehouse Management System, where products can be added and removed and statistics can be viewed as well. This project was completed as part of an OOP module done during the first year of my Computer Science course at University. Although in the "part01" source folder there is a command-line based version of this system. I will be detailing the more User-Friendly version found in the "part03" source folder!
## Getting Started
In order to start using the Retail Management System Application, run the `WarehouseApplication` Java file found within the "Part03" source folder. This will open up a larger, more Graphical, command line interface which can be used to perform operations.

As soon as the new window opens up you will be presented with 8 different menu options, which in order are:
1. Add new Product
2. Delete a Product
3. List all Products for a Department
4. List all Products
5. Add Stock for a Product
6. Sales Report
7. Record Purchase
8. Exit

You are then also prompted to enter which process you wish to carry out by entering the process' assigned number. So, for example, if you wish to add a new Product to the Warehouse catalog then you would enter "1". I will now go through each of the 7 main processes, as when you enter 8, as expected the application ends and you then have to manually close the window of the command line interface
