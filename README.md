## About

This Object Oriented Programming Project uses Java to create a basic functioning Retail Warehouse Management System, where products can be added and removed and statistics can be viewed as well. This project was completed as part of an OOP module done during the first year of my Computer Science course at University. Although in the "part01" source folder there is a command-line based version of this system. I will be detailing the more User-Friendly version found in the "part03" source folder!
